They started in the **DVD by mail** business around 1998. In 2007 they\nexpanded its business with the introduction of streaming media (like online TV series and movies). Netflix\ndebuted its first series **House of Cards**.\n\nToday Netflix is available aver 190 countries, has 86 million subscribers\nand produces around 126 original series or films a year\n\n### Recommendation Engine\n\nThe core business of Netflix is their recommendation algorithm. It is used to recommend users on\nmovies/series they might like (thus keeping them attracted to their services) and gives insights to the company\non what kind of movies their users like (Director, actors, genres, etc.) so the company can produce content that\nwill fit the users' desires.\n\n\n### Netflix Prize\nThe Netflix Prize was an open competition for the best algorithm to predict user ratings for films, based\non previous ratings (without any other information about the users or films). The grand prize of $1,000,000 was\ngiven in 2009 to **Pragmatic Chaos team** which bested Netflix's own algorithm for predicting ratings by **10.06 %**\n\n\n### Types of Recommendation Engines\n1. Recommend the most popular items\n    * Always recommend the items which are liked by most number of users.\n    * Fast and easy to implement.\n    * No personalization (all the users will get the same recommendation).\n    * Example: news portals.\n\n2. Content based algorithm\n    * Idea: If you like an item then you will also like \"similar\" items.\n    * Works well when it's easy to determine the properties of each item (so we can define which items are \"similar\").\n    * Example: movie or song recommendations.\n    \n3. Collaborative filtering algorithm\n    * Idea: If a person A likes item 1, 2, 3 and B likes 2, 3, 4. Then they have similar interests and A should\nlike item 4 and B should like item 1.\n    * The algorithm is entirely based on past behavior and is not dependent on any additional information.\n    * Example: product recommendations in e-commerce (like Amazon)\n\n\n---\n\n## The exercise\n* We will build our own Recommendation System using MapReduce.\n* The type of engine we want to implement is a version of the **\"Content based algorithm\"**.\n\n### Similarity\nWe define similarity between two movies like this:\n\n`sim(movie1, movie2) = Number of users who liked both movie1 and movie2`\n\n#### Example:\nIf:\n\n* `User A likes movies: 1,2,3,4`\n* `User B likes movies: 1,2,5`\n* `User C likes movies: 1,2,4`\n\nThen:\n```\n| sim | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n|-----|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1   | - | 3 | 1 | 2 | 1 |\n| 2   | 3 | - | 1 | 2 | 1 |\n| 3   | 1 | 1 | - | 1 | 0 |\n| 4   | 2 | 2 | 1 | - | 0 |\n| 5   | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | - |\n```\n\n\n* What movie is the most similar to movie 1?\n    * Just go to the row of movie 1 and find the movie with the highest **similarity value**. In this case its movie 2 with a similarity of 3.\n    * Therefore, if a new user \"likes\" movie 1, our recommendation system will recommend him to watch also movie 2.\n\n### The Challenge\nWhat's the difficulty in this approach?\n\nNone really! Just a little bit of planning from our side. Let's define the steps to solve this problem:\n\n#### Step 1 - List of pairs\nFor every user, we want to build a list of pairs between all the movies (sorted by the first value),\nfor example:\n```\nUser A: (1,2) (1,3) (1,4) (2,3) (2,4) (3,4)\nUser B: (1,2) (1,5) (2,5)\nUser C: (1,2) (1,4) (2,4)\n```\n\n##### _Bonus Question_\nHow many pairs are going to be there for every user?\n\nAnswer: `(n choose 2) = n!/((n-2)!2!)`, where `n = # movies liked`\n\n#### Step 2 - Similarity Value \nSum how many pairs have the same values (this will give us the \"similarity value\" defined above), for example:\n```\n(1,2) = 3\n(1,3) = 1\n(1,4) = 2\nYou get the point...\n```\n\nWith this information we can build our similarity table and the recommendation engine is done!\n\n#### A Big Data problem\nWe can implement the algorithm without any problem. But what will happen if we try to apply it on all Netflix's data? Let's do some math..\n\n* Netflix has `86 million users`.\n* Let's imagine that on average every user liked `50 movies`.\n* Then for every user we will have `(50 choose 2) = 1225` pairs of movies.\n* In total, there would be: `86,000,000 * 1225 = 105,350,000,000` pairs!\n* That would be approximately `1.4 Terabytes (!!)` of produced output.\n* And for every pair we need to find the times it appears! (In other words, we need to search 1.5T for every pair to find duplicates!!)\n* This will take a loooooot of time and a complex logic because our OS won't be able to keep all that info the memory!\n* This is a classic problem that can be solved using Map Reduce and that will be our task.\n\nCalculation for geeks - How did we arrive to 1.4 TB?\n* Java int = `4 bytes`.\n* Java char = `2 bytes`.\n* Assume we save each pair as above, then we have 3 chars for `(`, `)` and `,` + two integers for each movie ID\n* So each pair will be stored with `14 bytes`.\n* `1 GB = 1,073,741,824 bytes`\n* `105,350,000,000 pairs * 14 bytes =  1,474,900,000,000 bytes = 1,373 GB = 1.4 TB`\n\n \n---\n \n## The implementation\n### Goal:\n* For each movie, find the top 10 movies with highest similarity (and their 'similarity value').\n\n \n### Input:\n* File: `ratings_small.csv`.\n* Schema: `userId, movieId, rating, timestamp`.\n\n### Output:\n* File: `recommendations.csv`.\n* Schema: `movieId, first_similar_movie_id (x 'Similarity Value'), ... tenth_similar_movie_id (x 'Similarity Value')`\n* Example: `5380, 780 (x23), 588 (x18), ..., 8665 (x15)`.\n    * Meaning: If a user lies movie `5308`, we will recommend him movie `780` as the first option, etc.\n\n### Jobs:\nTake this as a helpful hint, you can think about another algorithm to solve the problem. \nEach Job can be a mix of Map/Reduce or just one of them.\n\n#### Job #1\nConvert input file to a file that contains the userID followed by a list of all the movies the user liked.\nSchema: `userID, movie1Liked, movie2Liked, ..., movieNLiked`\n\n#### Job #2\nCompute all movie pairs (with the mapper) and the similarity between two movies (reducer)\n\nHint: The reducer's output should be: `Key: movie1ID, Value: <similarityValue, movie2ID>` \n\n#### Job #3\nReceive a movie and all the movies with similarity bigger than 0 and write the movieID and the 10 movies with the highest similarity (reducer)\nMerge the output into a new file `recommendations_merged.csv`.\n\n#### Cleaning the output\nOnce you confirm that the output in `recommendations_merged.csv` is the expected one. Remove the string `(x 'Similarity Value')` from each column \nso you end up with a dataset of only numbers.\n\nSave this output to a new file: `recommendations_clean.csv`\n\n* Schema: `movieId, first_similar_movie_id, ... tenth_similar_movie_id`\n* Example: `5380, 780, 588, ..., 8665`."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Netflix MRJob"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Write your code here"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Cleaning the output"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Write your code here"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":5}],"metadata":{"name":"03_NetflixRecommendations_MapReduce","notebookId":1876425241492383},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
